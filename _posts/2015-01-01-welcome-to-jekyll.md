Actually, Today is the first day of my blog. I signed up this blog to record something about my work and life. In the coming period, I hope I can write something everyday about meeting minutes or just English dictation. but my english is so poor that maybe technology sharing will be presented in mandarin. hope my spoken and listening english improve dramatically.

Even though I feel tried and unhappy after personnel adjustments, I still want to motivate myslef. Everyone should be responsible for their own choices, and so do I. Maybe I feel bule just because the sky is not so bule.


## section 1

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
